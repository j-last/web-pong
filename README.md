# web_pong

 This project was completed inside a workshop with the University of York society YorDevs.

 The aim of this project was to teach us about the HTML 'canvas' tag, which allowed us to create a simple game (pong) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 This improved my knowledge about web development languages, allowing me to (after the session) perfect the code to make it look like a professional game with nicely written, efficient, readable code (unlike the spaghetti code of the game I made when I first learnt JavaScript!).
